## Project Overview

Threadsafe is a TypeScript CLI tool that backs up saved Threads posts as Obsidian-compatible markdown. Uses Playwright to automate a Chromium browser, scrolling through `threads.com/saved` and intercepting GraphQL API responses to extract post data.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript with ESNext/NodeNext module resolution
- Playwright (Chromium only) for browser automation
- tsx for direct TS execution (no build step needed)
- node:test + node:assert for unit tests
- Playwright for render validation (headless gallery checking)

## Key Commands

- `npm start` — Run the backup tool (`tsx src/index.ts`)
- `npm start -- --output /path/to/dir` — Override output directory
- `npm start -- --output /path/to/dir --save-config` — Save output dir to `config.json`
- `npm start -- --gallery-only` — Regenerate gallery HTML without scraping
- `npm start -- --url <post-url> --output /tmp/test` — Scrape a single post to an isolated directory (skips state tracking)
- `npm start -- --dump-raw` — Dump raw scraped JSON to disk for inspection (no parsing/download/state update). Combine with `--url` for a single post.
- `npm start -- --reset` — Delete all posts, state, and gallery, then re-scrape everything. Preserves downloaded assets.
- `npm start -- --reset-all` — Same as `--reset` but also deletes assets (full clean slate).
- `npm run serve` — Start local gallery server at localhost:3000 with in-app refresh button
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — Type check without emitting
- `npm test` — Run unit tests (`tests/gallery.test.ts`, `tests/parser.test.ts`)
- `npm run validate` — Run Playwright render validation (generates gallery from fixtures, opens in headless Chromium, checks for JS errors)
- `npm run validate -- path/to/index.html` — Validate an existing gallery file

## Architecture

The pipeline flows: **config -> auth -> scrape -> parse -> download -> markdown -> state -> gallery**

- `config.ts` — Loads persistent settings from `config.json`, merges with CLI args (`--output`, `--save-config`). Priority: CLI flag > config.json > default `./output`.
- `auth.ts` — Manages Playwright session persistence via `session.json`. First run opens headed browser for manual login; subsequent runs reuse saved cookies.
- `scraper.ts` — Navigates to `/saved`, listens for `response` events on `/graphql/query` endpoints, and scrolls to `document.body.scrollHeight` in a loop. Initial posts come from `<script data-sjs>` tags; subsequent pages come from intercepted network responses. Stops after 8 consecutive empty scrolls or when a known post ID is encountered.
- `parser.ts` — Recursively searches nested JSON for objects with `post.pk` or `thread_items` keys. Extracts post ID, author, text, timestamp, media URLs, profile picture URL, engagement metrics, and reply status (via `text_post_app_info.is_reply` and `reply_to_author`).
- `downloader.ts` — Downloads images with concurrency limit of 3. Skips videos (preserves URL for linking). Skips already-downloaded files. Also downloads author profile pictures (one per author, always overwritten to stay current).
- `markdown.ts` — Generates `.md` files with YAML frontmatter. Filenames: `@author-slug-YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Handles collisions with counter suffix.
- `state.ts` — Tracks backed-up post IDs in `state.json` for incremental backups.
- `gallery.ts` — Reads all markdown files, parses frontmatter, scans assets directory for images and profile pictures, and generates a self-contained `index.html` gallery. Runs after every backup (even when no new posts). Uses incremental rendering (50-post batches via IntersectionObserver) for performance with 1000+ posts. Profile pictures render as circular avatars with fallback to colored initials. Reply posts show a "Replying to @author" banner in the feed.
- `pipeline.ts` — Reusable scrape pipeline (auth -> scrape -> parse -> download -> markdown -> state -> gallery) with a progress callback. Used by both `index.ts` (CLI) and `server.ts` (serve mode).
- `server.ts` — Local HTTP server for serve mode. Serves gallery at localhost:3000, injects a refresh button and progress overlay via SSE. The static `index.html` on disk remains standalone.

## Validation (required after changes)

After any change to gallery.ts or types.ts, run all three:

1. `npx tsc --noEmit` — Type check
2. `npm test` — Unit tests for parsing logic
3. `npm run validate` — Playwright render check (catches JS runtime errors in generated HTML)

The gallery embeds JavaScript inside a TypeScript template literal — this means JS syntax errors won't be caught by tsc. The render validation is the only way to catch those.

When debugging gallery JS failures, don't guess — generate the HTML and inspect it:
```
npx tsx -e "import { generateHtml } from './src/gallery.ts'; import { writeFileSync } from 'fs'; writeFileSync('/tmp/gallery-debug.html', generateHtml([])); console.log('Done');"
```
Then read the generated file to see what the JS actually looks like. The `npm run validate` Playwright test also prints the temp file path — you can read that file to inspect the output.

## Real-world verification

Verify against real data before considering work complete.

How: use `--url` with `--output` to test a single post without touching normal output:
```
npm start -- --url https://www.threads.net/post/XYZ --output /tmp/threadsafe-test
```
Then open the generated `index.html` and check that the post looks correct. For gallery-only changes, `--gallery-only` against real output is sufficient.

## Important Patterns

- The Threads JSON structure is undocumented and deeply nested. The parser uses recursive key searching rather than fixed paths, which makes it resilient to minor structural changes.
- The domain is `threads.com` (not `threads.net`) — the site redirects.
- GraphQL responses during scroll are small (one post per response), not batched.
- Scrolling must go to `document.body.scrollHeight` (not just one viewport) to trigger new content loads.
- **Template literal escaping in gallery.ts:** All the client-side JavaScript in `gallery.ts` lives inside a TypeScript template literal. Backslashes in JS code (regex `\s`, `\/`, etc.) get consumed by the template literal, so they must be double-escaped (`\\s`, `\\/`). When adding new JS functions with regex patterns, always generate the HTML to a file and inspect the output to verify escaping is correct.

## Documentation

When making user-facing changes (new flags, changed behavior, new commands), check if README.md and this file need updating. CLI flags should be documented in both the Key Commands section here and the Usage section of README.md.

## Sensitive Files (gitignored)

- `config.json` — Persistent settings (output directory)
- `session.json` — Browser cookies, never commit
- `state.json` — Backup state
- `output/` — Default output (user's backed-up content)
